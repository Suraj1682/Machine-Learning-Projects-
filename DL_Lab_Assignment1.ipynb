        "**Step 7: Analysis**\n",
        "Analyze the results. Compare the performance of different hyperparameter settings. Look for patterns and trends in the training and validation curves. Identify which hyperparameters led to better convergence and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 8: Fine-tuning**\n",
        "Based on your analysis, you might want to fine-tune the hyperparameters further. For example, if you find that a lower learning rate improves convergence, you can perform a more focused search around that range.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 9: Reporting**\n",

        "Remember that experimenting with different hyperparameters is an iterative process. It's important to document your experiments and findings thoroughly. This exercise will not only deepen your understanding of CNNs but also teach you about the impact of hyperparameters on training and performance."
